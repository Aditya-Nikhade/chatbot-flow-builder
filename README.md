##Chatbot Flow Builder##

I have made this project with Vite, Zustand, React Flow, Tailwind and Playwright.
I have used a CI job to make sure that the code is properly formatted and passes the required tests on every pull request.

Also locally on every commit, a Husky command makes sure that code is properly formatted and there are no linter errors.

Future Improvements:
1. Other node types can be added in this project(check node.config.jsx)
2. Google Auth and jwt authentication can be added for authentication
3. The ability to save a project
4. A burger icon with another sidepanel displaying the saved projects.
